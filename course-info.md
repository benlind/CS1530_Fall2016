This course provides students with a broad understanding of modern software engineering. Although it will cover theory, the emphasis is on providing practical skills in software engineering currently used in industry. To that end, it will cover project and product management, software architecture and design patterns, team communications, and other material relevant to __engineering__ software instead of just __coding__ it.

## Grading

* Mid-term Exam 1 - 15%
* Mid-term Exam 2 - 15%
* Group Project:
  * Sprint 1 Deliverable - 10%
  * Sprint 2 Deliverable - 10% 
  * Sprint 3 Deliverable - 10%
  * Sprint 4 Deliverable - 10%
  * Final Deliverable and Presentation - 20%
* Class Participation - 10% (Exercises and Guest Lecture attendance)

It is strongly recommended that you come to class each for each lecture.  Material may be presented or covered in class that is not in the reading.  I also expect active participation in class (there will be various projects done in class).  However,  I will only take roll for the class exercise days.  On these days, attendance and participation is mandatory.

The syllabus is subject to modification if circumstances dictate (e.g. a guest lecturer is unable to make the scheduled day).

The following grading scale will be used.

Score  | Grade
-----: | ------------------------------
100.00-94.00 | A (A+ for extraordinary work)
93.99-91.00  | A-
90.99-88.00  | B+
87.99-84.00  | B
83.99-81.00  | B-
80.99-78.00  | C+
77.99-74.00  | C
73.99-71.00  | C-
70.99-68.00  | D+
67.99-64.00  | D
63.99-61.00  | D-
60.99-0.00   | F

All groups are expected to do their own work on the group project, but are more than welcome to collaborate and ask questions with other groups, the Internet, or other colleagues.

However, any student caught collaborating or cheating on an exam will automatically receive a 0 (zero) for that exam, and may be penalized more harshly based on University of Pittsburgh academic policy.

Note that there are two mid-terms, and no final exams.  The second mid-term exam willnot be cumulative.

It is recommended you keep all of your graded assignments until final grades are posted and accepted, in order to resolve any discrepancies in grading.

## Attendance

Presence for the mid-term exams and class exercises are REQUIRED.  They will be individually re-scheduled only in the event of an emergency.  If you are facing an emergency, please contact the instructor IMMEDIATELY (if it is safe to do so, of course).  Failure to show up for an exam without clearing it first with the instructor will result in a 0 (zero) for that exam or exercise.

## Group Project Details

Students will be grouped into groups of 4 or 5, and will work on a project for the duration of the course.  There will be several sprints, at the end of each of which the students will have a working version of their software available on GitHub or GitLab, as well as documentation and other information (specified for each particular sprint).

Deliverables must be committed to GitHub or GitLab by the beginning of class on the day that it is due.  Late deliverables will NOT be accepted unless authorized __at least 24 hours before the due date__.

## Extra Credit

Bonus points (at the discretion of the instructor) will be given if you give a talk to a a programming meetup or conference.

## Programming Language Selection

All software projects for this course will be written in the Rust language.
