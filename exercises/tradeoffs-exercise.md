## Software Engineering Trade-Offs Exercise

Meet with your group, and determine three times that you had to make trade-offs in order to create a working product.

Think about this from different angles, such as:

1. Trade-offs in engineering decisions (did you choose between Swing and JavaFx?)
2. Trade-offs in quality (did you not test as much as certain points?)
3. Trade-offs in scope (did you choose to implement one feature or another)

This is not a complete list!  What other kinds of trade-offs ight you have made?

Afterwards, we will have a discussion on the trade-offs to see how the ones your group made compare with the other groups in the class.
