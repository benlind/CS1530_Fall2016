    REAL ARTISTS SHIP - YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE TRADE-OFFS

* Why should you NOT take this course?

   Not interested in practical applications

   Never going to write software > 20 lines of code

   You want a professor who only reads off of slides

   Want a professor who wears a tie to class

* Why should you take this course?

   You want to write better software

   You want to work effectively

   You want to know what I meant by "better" and "effectively"

   What do you think I mean by "better"?  What makes software "good"?
